# DLAI_Prj2022
Project for DLAI 2022 at La Sapienza, playing around with contrastive learning and 3d shapes. 

### How to run

Either use Colab or install pytorch and the other dependencies (Pytorch geometric). 
Note that there are 2 versions of the code:
- v1: original version in folder v1
- v2: new version, rewritten to work with WANDB (still WIP)
