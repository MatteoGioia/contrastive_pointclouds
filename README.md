# DLAI_Prj2022
Project for DLAI 2022 at La Sapienza, playing around with contrastive learning and 3d shapes. 

### How to run

Either use Colab or install pytorch and the other dependencies (Pytorch geometric). 
Note that there are 2 versions of the code:
- v1: original version in folder v1 (with pretrained models, saved in a generic format)
- v2: new version, rewritten to work with WANDB 

Note that the second version requires a WANDB account to work and visualize all the graphs. If everything is done correctly, you should see something like this:


### Code attributions

Here are listed code attributions for the notebooks:
- pytorch geometric tutorials
- wandb pytorch integration
- pygCL:

Note that while no part of pygCL was used in this repository I still used their code to understand common patterns in contrastive training.
All the other relevant attributions are in the report.
